      **First professional role** where I learned the fundamentals of web development in a fast-paced startup environment.

      Responsibilities included:
      - Maintaining legacy `PHP/MySQL` applications while gradually modernizing the stack
      - Building new features using JavaScript and jQuery (yes, this was 2015!)
      - Performing database optimizations - turned a **45-second query** into sub-second response time
      - Participating in daily standups and sprint planning meetings

      > This role taught me more about debugging, problem-solving, and reading legacy code than any bootcamp could. Made plenty of mistakes, but that's how you learn!
