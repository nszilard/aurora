# Building a Web Application with React and Node.js

In this tutorial, we'll be building a simple web application using React on the front-end and Node.js on the back-end. We'll start by setting up a basic file structure and then move on to creating the user interface using React. After that, we'll build the back-end using Node.js and connect it to the front-end. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional web application that you can customize to fit your needs.

## Setting up the Project

Before we get started, we need to set up our project. We'll be using `create-react-app` to create our React application and `express` to create our Node.js server.

First, let's create a new React app by running the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
```

Next, let's install `express` and `cors` by running the following command:

```bash
npm install express cors
```

Now that we have our dependencies installed, let's create a new file called `server.js` in the root of our project directory. In this file, we'll create our Node.js server and connect it to our React app. Here's what our `server.js` file should look like:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();

app.use(cors());

app.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 5000');
});
```

## Creating the User Interface with React

Now that our server is set up, let's create the user interface using React. We'll start by creating a few components: a header component, a form component, and a display component. Here's what our `App.js` file should look like:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Header from './components/Header';
import Form from './components/Form';
import Display from './components/Display';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <Form />
      <Display />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Next, let's create our form component. We'll use a table to lay out our form and some Bootstrap classes to style it. Here's what our `Form.js` file should look like:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Form() {
  return (
    <form>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <label htmlFor="name">Name:</label>
            </td>
            <td>
              <input type="text" id="name" name="name" />
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <label htmlFor="email">Email:</label>
            </td>
            <td>
              <input type="email" id="email" name="email" />
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <label htmlFor="password">Password:</label>
            </td>
            <td>
              <input type="password" id="password" name="password" />
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td colSpan="2">
              <button type="submit">Submit</button>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </form>
  );
}

export default Form;
```
