## General and crucial instructions

- Never ever run `git push`!
- Never add additional readme or markdown (.md) files unless explicitly asked for!
- Never add comments to the code you generate unless explicitly asked!
- Whenever there are multiple options, always chose the one which is done with less code AND is simpler!
- Do not over-complicate the solutions: always try to achieve the result in the most efficient way!
- When there are multiple options to solve an issue, never automatically chose one; always ask for input!

## Critical Context

This is a Hugo theme called Aurora. I built it to serve my personal website, and the main aim is to have a modern, minimalistic
style which suits my style and where I can host my online portfolio/CV . Additionally, i decided to also have a page where I can
showcase my open-source projects (`/projects`) and can also serve as a blog (`/posts`).

This also has the `exampleSite` folder, where I create an example site to display this theme. This example site is served
under my github profile, thus the URL for it is: `nszilard.github.io/aurora/`. This is important, as my personal site is 
also hosted on github, under: `nszilard.github.io`. Thus, it is important that these 2 sites won't affect each other!
